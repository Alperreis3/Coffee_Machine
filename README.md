# Coffee Machine

This code simulates a coffee machine that can make three types of drinks: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The ingredients and costs for each drink are stored in a dictionary called MENU. The user can choose which drink they would like to order by inputting the drink name.

# Getting Started
To run this code, you will need a Python interpreter. No additional dependencies are required.

# Usage
To use the coffee machine, run the code and follow the prompts. You will be asked to choose a drink from the menu by inputting the name of the drink. If the ingredients are sufficient to make the chosen drink, you will be prompted to insert coins to make the payment. If the payment is accepted, the coffee machine will make the drink and output the change.

You can also enter "report" to view the current stock of ingredients and the total profit made so far, or "off" to turn the coffee machine off.

# Known Issues
The code does not currently handle input validation, so entering an invalid drink name or invalid coin values may cause the code to crash.

# Future Development
* Implement input validation to handle invalid user input.
* Add additional drinks to the menu.
* Implement a system for restocking the ingredients.
